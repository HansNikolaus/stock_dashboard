    "* Learnings \n",
    "    * That Streamlit is an EXCELLENT tool and perhaps even my favorite for visualizing data now due to the speed at which you can create something and the level customizability. I also learned more about cloudflare and authentication for websites in general. Finally, I learned a lot about the statistics being extracted or created, and what they mean and what they are used for. Hopefully I can invest better now.\n",

    "    * I think its probably similar to my anwsers from the challenges that I had. When you go through something difficult you grow a lot, and this is a great feeling to have. Also, this project was very interesting and fun for me from the beginning. It was a very similar idea I had for a personal project for some time, so I am thrilled that this project has helped me to kick start that idea, and I am proud that the initial idea I had was perhaps a good one."
